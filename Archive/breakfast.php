                 <p> My favourite dish for breakfast is a strawberry and banana smoothie. </p>

                 This is a pretty straightforward and simple dish to make but also tastes so good. To make this dish it just requires a handful of strawberries, bananas, ice and some milk. Then you just throw that all in a smoothie maker or blender and itâ€™s ready to drink!

                 What i love about this dish is that it requires no culinary skills and can be made in just minutes. Which is perfect for me as I have little cooking abilities and also no time in the mornings when I have to rush to school.

                 Smoothies are the best go-to option in the mornings because of how fast and easy it is to prepare and also how good it tastes.
